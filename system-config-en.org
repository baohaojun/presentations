* A kind of UX：interactive completion
** In Firefox

[[./images/firefox.ps]]

** In Emacs

[[./images/emacs.ps]]

** In File Manager？

[[./images/file-manager.ps]]

** On the Command Line

[[./images/ui-cli.ps]]

** On the Command Line(2)

*** s (search engine)
*** git checkout -B
*** git cherry-pick


** In T1Wrench
[[./images/wrench-ui.ps]]

** Everywhere

*** Sawfish Desktop Window Manager
*** Emacs Commands —— helm
*** Variations on Command Line
*** In my input method
*** In Smartisan phone, Mail contact search

* The most important 7 weapons
** Editor (Emacs)
*** Programs, documents, they are all texts
*** All kinds of completion
- C/C++ (Qt/Visual C++): auto-complete-clang-async.el
- Java: ajoke.el
- bbyac: type a Bit and Bang You Are Completed
- yasnippet
- codegen
- getopts/getopt
*** Using Emacs to read code

** Emacs (code reading)
*** beagrep: combines search engine and grep
*** grep-beatags: combines search engine and ctags-exuberant and grep
*** grep-func-call: search for usages
*** local variable definition lookup
*** local variable usage lookup
** Emacs (document reading)
*** man pages
*** info pages
*** html —— delegated to firefox
** CLI (xfce4-terminal + bash)
*** history for bash
- bash's native history: up/down, Ctrl-r/Ctrl-s
- re
- cd history
*** using tools together
- of: open file
- putclip
- cut the current command
- up: copy the unix path
** Browser (Firefox)
*** Emacs key bindings for firefox with Firemacs and Sawfish (reading blogs)
*** Write monkeygrease JavaScript
*** As my document reader
*** As my dictionary tool
** Window manager (sawfish)
*** Help integrate all other tools
- Help Emacs code reading
- Help QtCreator to edit with Emacs
*** Define your own hotkeys
*** Have different editing modes like Vim
*** Emacs key bindings for all windows

** Version Control (git)
*** Coupling Git with my scripts (refactory-rename)
*** git-interactive-add
*** system-config is managed by git, too
*** Use git before you write first line of code, in any project

** Operating System (Linux)

*** Why are these tools important？
- Allow user to soak in, flow

- I don't hate the mouse, switching hurts
  * Why do I do the dictionary lookup with mouse

** Human Being (Yourself)
*** Only a human being can wield the other weapons
* Summary
** s: Why is the name so short
***  Huffman code theory
*** Easy things easier
*** Hard things easy
*** Impossible things possible
*** Reduce required steps
*** Decompose into smaller tasks
*** Top down and bottom up
** Program by wishful thinking
*** Todo lists: jwz's programming method
- Introduction to org-mode
- GTD: get things done
*** Linus's programming method
*** sicp & htdp
** 7 habits of effective text editing
*** Don't learn everything at once, learn by doing
*** Fork my system-config project
- https://github.com/baohaojun/system-config
*** Maybe start learning Emacs?

** Thanks
